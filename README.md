## üìö Installation

For quick installation of the contract `ABIs`:

### Javascript/Typescript

```bash
npm install @oceanprotocol/contracts
```

### Python

```bash
pip3 install ocean-contracts
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

By default, Python does not support importing `json` files directly, so it is recommended to use `json-sempai` package in order to automatically importing `ABIs/json` artifacts.

```
pip3 install json-sempai
# install the ocean-contracts package.
```

```python
from jsonsempai import magic
from artifacts import address
```

## Overview

![image](docs/images/smart-contracts.png)

## üèÑ Quickstart

### Features

- Base IP is now represented by an [NFT](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/what-is-a-data-nft-5804a2d88671), from which a datapublisher can create multiple ERC20s representing different type of access for the same dataset.

- An automated Datatoken [Staking](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378) helps with the initial DTs distribution and price stability. Goodbye rug pulls!

- Help [Ocean Community Monetize](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-to-make-money-from-ocean-v4-477b3decad51): there's a swap fee for the Ocean Community, if Ocean or allied tokens are the basetoken in a pool, Ocean Community will receive 0.1% swap fee, otherwhise it will be 0.2%.

#### Flexibility

- Introduce an advanced [Fee Structure](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/fees) both for Market and Provider runners.

- Roles Administration: there are now multiple roles for a more flexible administation both at NFT and ERC20 levels

- Key-value store in the NFT contract : NFT contract can be used to store custom key-value pairs (ERC725Y standard)

- Multiple NFT template support: the Factory can deploy different types of NFT templates

- Multiple datatoken template support: the Factory can deploy different types of Datatoken templates

npm install
npx hardhat node
```

Open a new terminal to run the tests:

```bash
export ALCHEMY_URL="https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/XXXXXXXX"

npm run test:full
# same thing, but with coverage reporting
npm run test:full:cover
```
